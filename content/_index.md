# Home

Hi, I'm James. I'm a BEng Computing graduate from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), and I'm currently working for 
[Netcraft](https://netcraft.com).

## Current Work

My final year project at Imperial College London, conducted in collaboration with Netcraft, involved developing a system
for the detection of servers using incorrect IP geolocation. This project was successful, and since joining
Netcraft full-time my job has involved integrating this system into their business.

The current iteration of the system is written in [Go](https://golang.org) -- my language of choice at the
moment.

## Technical Interests

My main interest is in writing back-end code. When doing this, I enjoy working with `vim`, `tmux` and `zsh`.
The languages I'm most comfortable in are Go, Python and Java.
