Hi, I'm James. I'm a software engineer, currently working at
[Netcraft](https://netcraft.com), an internet security and research company. I
graduated with a BEng in Computing from [Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) in 2020.

I'm interested in various areas of technology, from cybersecurity to
networking to programming language design.

My [final year
project](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-engineering/computing/public/1920-ug-projects/Williams,-James-(jw1317).pdf)
at Imperial focused on building an spoof-resistant IP geolocation system.
I've given a number of talks about this system, including [an Applications of
Computing in Industry talk at
Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/industry/aci/2020-21/netcraft/).

More information about me can be found on my
